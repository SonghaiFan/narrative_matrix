Hamas was a much smaller Palestinian group compared to the then-dominant Fatah movement led by Yasser Arafat. Initially, Hamas' role was limited. The group was a spoiler that undermined progress in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations of the 1990s by unleashing major attacks at sensitive moments. When the Palestinians launched an uprising, or intifada, in 2000, Hamas carried out a stream of suicide bombers that inflicted mass casualties on Israelis. Hamas was clearly growing more powerful and attracted more followers, particularly among young men in Gaza who felt they had no future.",
