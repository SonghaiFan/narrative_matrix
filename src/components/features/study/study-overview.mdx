# User Study Overview

## Study Design

This research employs a between-subjects experimental design to evaluate different approaches to narrative visualization. The study aims to understand how various visualization techniques affect users' comprehension and interaction with narrative data.

### Experimental Conditions

1. **Pure Text Narrative (Control)**

   - Traditional text-based presentation
   - Linear narrative structure
   - No interactive elements

2. **Text with Visualization**

   - Text accompanied by interactive visualizations
   - Data-driven visual representations
   - Interactive exploration capabilities

3. **Text with Chat Interface**

   - Text presentation with an AI-powered chat interface
   - Query-based information retrieval
   - Natural language interaction

4. **Mixed Approach**
   - Combined visualization and chat interface
   - Interactive visual elements
   - AI-assisted exploration

## Methodology
