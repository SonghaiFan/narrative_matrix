          : "No events are currently available."

      CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
      You MUST reference specific events in EVERY response using the format [Event #X] where X is the event ID.
      For example: "As we can see in [Event #5], the character's motivation becomes clear."
      
      This format creates interactive links in the interface that users can click to navigate to specific events.
      
      RULES FOR REFERENCES:
      1. Include at least 2-3 event references in each response
      2. Always use the exact format [Event #X] - with square brackets, the word "Event", a space, # symbol, and the number
      3. Only reference events that exist in the narrative (events with IDs mentioned in the context)
      4. Make your references relevant to the discussion
      5. When answering general questions, cite specific events as evidence
      
      EXAMPLE GOOD RESPONSE:
      "The main character's journey begins with their initial challenge in [Event #2]. This creates tension that builds through [Event #5] and [Event #8], eventually leading to the resolution we see in [Event #12]."
      
      Do not validate or check if the user's references to events are correct. Simply respond to their questions while following the reference format requirements.`,
